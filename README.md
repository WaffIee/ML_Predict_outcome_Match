This study aims to improve the prediction of NBA game outcomes by developing and comparing models that effectively analyze various game and team-related features. The NBA, as the most renowned basketball league, represents a signif- icant business entity with substantial financial interests. To gain deeper insights into the game, its strategies, and the factors influencing results, NBA data an- alysts conduct extensive research. This paper outlines a systematic approach, starting with data pre-processing to extract relevant features and construct new ones. Feature importance analysis is then utilized to identify the most influential factors. Multiple learning techniques are employed to create prediction mod- els, and their performance is thoroughly evaluated. The analysis reveals that the Elo rating, considering both home and visitor approaches, emerges as the most significant feature, while the Random Forest model achieves the highest accuracy rate 71/100.
